Case Study 1: Securing Sensitive Messages for Financial Transactions

Objective: A financial organization wants to secure sensitive customer information and transactions using cryptography. They aim to create a robust C-based cryptographic system for encrypting, decrypting, and verifying the integrity of messages.

Problem: Due to increased cyber-attacks targeting financial data, the organization faces significant risks if any unauthorized access occurs. Data breaches could lead to loss of customer trust, regulatory fines, and severe legal implications.

Solution:
1. Prime Number Generation for Key Creation: The team uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate large prime numbers for RSA keys. This ensures secure encryption by relying on computationally intensive prime factorization.
  
2. RSA Encryption and Decryption:
   - Data Structure: Arrays store keys and encrypted messages.
   - Encryption: Customer data, such as account numbers and transaction amounts, are encrypted with the public key before being stored or transmitted. RSA’s modular exponentiation ensures that only holders of the private key can decrypt the information.
  
3. SHA-1 Hashing:
   - A message digest is created for each transaction, providing a unique fingerprint of the data.
   - This hash is used to ensure data integrity so any minor tampering in data results in a mismatch, alerting security teams of potential breaches.

4. Digital Signatures:
   - After hashing, the organization uses digital signatures to authenticate the transaction origin. Each hash is encrypted with the private key to create a signature, which is then validated at the receiving end.
  
Outcome: By implementing this cryptographic solution, the organization secures its transaction pipeline, ensuring that all sensitive data is encrypted, hashed, and signed to prevent tampering and unauthorized access. 



Case Study 2: Secure Communication for a Remote Team

Objective: A company with a fully remote workforce needs to ensure secure communication channels for transmitting sensitive internal documents and messages.

Problem: The company deals with proprietary and confidential information, so any leaks or hacks could impact business competitiveness.

Solution:
1. Key Generation Using Prime Numbers: An initial key exchange protocol relies on RSA keys generated by large primes. This approach provides strong security and simplifies key management.
  
2. Encryption/Decryption Process with RSA:
   - Data Structure: Arrays store the private and public keys, with modular arithmetic functions used for secure message encryption.
   - Process: Each document or message is encrypted before transmission. Team members decrypt messages using their unique private keys, ensuring that only the intended recipient can view the message.
  
3. SHA-1 Hashing for Integrity:
   - Each message is hashed using a SHA-1-based function to provide data integrity. The receiving system hashes the decrypted message to confirm it matches the original, ensuring that no tampering occurred during transmission.

4. Digital Signatures:
   - The sender’s private key creates a digital signature for each hashed message. The recipient uses the sender's public key to decrypt and verify the hash, confirming the message’s authenticity.
  
Outcome: The remote team achieves secure communication, preventing interception or tampering by implementing encryption, hashing, and digital signatures.



Case Study 3: Implementing Digital Signatures for E-Voting

Objective: A government body seeks to implement a secure, transparent e-voting system using cryptographic techniques.

Problem: E-voting requires a system where voter data remains confidential, ballots are secure from tampering, and votes can be verified for authenticity.

Solution:
1. Prime Number Generation and Modular Arithmetic:
   - Using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, the system generates large primes, ensuring secure key creation for each voter and voting administrator.

2. RSA Encryption for Ballot Security:
   - Voters’ ballots are encrypted using public keys associated with their voting credentials.
   - Data Structure: Arrays store voters’ unique keys and ballots, enabling rapid processing of each ballot without compromising security.
  
3. SHA-1 Hashing for Verification:
   - Each ballot is hashed before submission, and the hash is stored securely. When votes are tallied, the system re-hashes each ballot to verify its authenticity.
  
4. Digital Signatures:
   - Voters sign their hashed ballots with their private keys, creating a unique signature. This signature enables administrators to verify that a ballot has not been altered.
   - Administrators can validate the signature using the voter’s public key, ensuring that each vote cast is genuine.

Outcome: The e-voting system achieves high security and transparency, protecting voter confidentiality while allowing the government to detect and prevent unauthorized vote alterations.



Case Study 4: Medical Data Security in Telemedicine

Objective: A healthcare provider offers telemedicine services and needs to protect sensitive patient information, including medical records and diagnostic reports, transmitted over the internet.

Problem: Telemedicine services involve the exchange of highly sensitive health data, which could lead to privacy violations and compliance issues if intercepted.

Solution:
1. Prime Number Generation: The healthcare provider uses large prime numbers to generate secure RSA keys for encrypting patient data.
  
2. RSA Encryption and Decryption:
   - Data Structure: Arrays store patient records, encrypted messages, and keys for secure data handling.
   - Encryption: All health records and communications between doctors and patients are encrypted with the public key. Only authorized parties with the private key can decrypt and access the data.
  
3. Hashing (SHA-1):
   - SHA-1 is used to generate a unique hash for each patient report, allowing verification of report integrity. Any modification to a report generates a different hash, signaling tampering.
  
4. Digital Signatures:
   - Doctors sign diagnostic reports with a digital signature. The report hash is encrypted with the doctor’s private key, and the patient can use the public key to verify authenticity.
  
Outcome: By implementing this cryptographic structure, the healthcare provider ensures patient data privacy, compliance with regulatory standards, and the integrity of diagnostic communications.



Case Study 5: Secure E-Commerce Payment Gateway

Objective: An e-commerce platform wants to secure its payment processing system to protect customer payment details, including credit card numbers, while complying with industry standards like PCI DSS.

Problem: Payment information is a high-value target for cybercriminals, and any data breach could result in financial losses, legal penalties, and damage to the platform’s reputation.

Solution:
1. Prime Number Generation for RSA Key Creation:
   - The platform generates strong RSA keys using prime numbers for securing customer data.

2. RSA Encryption and Decryption:
   - Data Structure: Arrays are used to store encrypted payment details securely.
   - Encryption: Payment information, such as credit card details and transaction IDs, is encrypted with a public key when submitted. Only the payment gateway’s private key can decrypt it, preventing exposure even if intercepted.
  
3. Hashing for Integrity:
   - A SHA-1 hash is generated for each transaction, ensuring data integrity by detecting any alterations.
  
4. Digital Signatures for Transaction Verification:
   - The e-commerce platform digitally signs transaction details using its private key to assure customers of data authenticity. The payment gateway verifies the signature using the platform’s public key.
  
Outcome: The platform achieves compliance with PCI DSS and enhances customer trust by protecting payment data from interception, tampering, and fraud.
